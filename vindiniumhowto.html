   <h1>VINDINIUM HOW TO</h1>
   
   <p>As stated on the website, "Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence 
   programming challenge. You have to take the control of a legendary hero 
   using the programming language of your choice. You will fight with other 
   AI for a predetermined number of turns and the hero with the greatest amount
   of gold will win." On this page I will be explaining how i went about making my AI.
   The first thing I needed to do was put in the skeleton of the code. I did this by 
   cloning from a given Vindinium template. I was now ready to construct my bot. 
   Just as with any other AI, the foundation of the bot was a series of if/else statements.
   First, I decided that it would be good to seek out health when my bot's life went under 
   20. Therefore, I typed in the following: <br> if(bot.yourBot.life &lt; 20){<br/>
   task = &quot;getHealth&quot;;} <br>My bot also needed to know when to attack, so I 
   decided that whenever the bot was healthy and had more than 60 life would be
   a good time to attack other bots. So, I put in the following right after: <br> 
   else if(bot.yourBot.life &gt; 60){<br/> task = &quot;attack&quot;<br/> } <br>
   Finally, it needed to know when to go to freemines, so I typed in this: <br>
   else{<br/> task = &quot;freemines&quot;; <br/> }. <br> Again, in summary what 
   this does is make the bot think "Is my health below 20? If so get health. 
   Is my health above 60? If so, then attack. If my health is between these
   two options, go to freemines." Now that my bot know WHAT to do though, 
   I need to teach it HOW to carry out all of this. As is commented in the 
   code itself, this is where the next segments of the writing come in. 
   The three pieces of code tell how to get to the nearest freemine, tavern, 
   and enemy respectively.
